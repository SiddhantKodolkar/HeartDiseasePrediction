Heart Disease Prediction using LogisticRegression(Binary Classification)

## Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms, which comes under the Supervised Learning technique. It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.In Logistic regression, instead of fitting a regression line, we fit an "S" shaped logistic function, which predicts two maximum values (0 or 1).
The curve from the logistic function indicates the likelihood of something such as whether the cells are cancerous or not, a mouse is obese or not based on its weight, etc.

For this project, a traget value of 1 will indicate that the patient is sufferring from a heart disease and a 0 will indicate a healthy heart.
